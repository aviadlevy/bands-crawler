Bands Crawler
=============

I needed data of top bands with photos.
I used [Britannica - list of bands](https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-bands-2026814).  
I think you can use them in other lists britanica offers.  
**Don't abuse britanica!!** use with caution
  
See [bands.csv](bands.csv) to see how the results will look like

----
Enricher
========
Not all britanica pages includes images, so i added an enricher from wikipedia to add missing images when needed.
  
See [bands_enriched.csv](bands_enriched.csv) to see how the results will look like
